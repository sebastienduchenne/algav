a
heavier
task
could

than
i
to

my
griefs
unspeakable
yet
that
the
world
may
witness
that
my
end
was
wrought
by
nature
not
by
vile
offence
i
ll
utter
what
my
sorrows
give
me
leave
in
syracusa
was
i
born
and
wed
unto
a
woman
happy
but
for
me
and
by
me
had
not
our
hap
been
bad
with
her
i
lived
in
joy
our
wealth
increased
by
prosperous
voyages
i
often
made
to
epidamnum
till
my
factor
s
death
and
the
great
care
of
goods
at
random
left
drew
me
from
kind
embracements
of
my
spouse
from
whom
my
absence
was
not
six
months
old
before
herself
almost
at
fainting
under
the
pleasing
punishment
that
women
bear
had
made
provision
for
her
following
me
and
soon
and
safe
arrived
where
i
was
there
had
she
not
been
long
but
she
became
a
joyful
mother
of
two
goodly
sons
and
which
was
strange
the
one
so
like
the
other
as
could
not
be
distinguish
d
but
by
names
that
very
hour
and
in
the
self
same
inn
a
meaner
woman
was
delivered
of
such
a
burden
male
twins
both
alike
those
for
their
parents
were
exceeding
poor
i
bought
and
brought
up
to
attend
my
sons
my
wife
not
meanly
proud
of
two
such
boys
made
daily
motions
for
our
home
return
unwilling
i
agreed
alas
too
soon
we
came
aboard
a
league
from
epidamnum
had
we
sail
d
before
the
always
wind
obeying
deep
gave
any
tragic
instance
of
our
harm
but
longer
did
we
not
retain
much
hope
for
what
obscured
light
the
heavens
did
grant
did
but
convey
unto
our
fearful
minds
a
doubtful
warrant
of
immediate
death
which
though
myself
would
gladly
have
embraced
yet
the
incessant
weepings
of
my
wife
weeping
before
for
what
she
saw
must
come
and
piteous
plainings
of
the
pretty
babes
that
mourn
d
for
fashion
ignorant
what
to
fear
forced
me
to
seek
delays
for
them
and
me
and
this
it
was
for
other
means
was
none
the
sailors
sought
for
safety
by
our
boat
and
left
the
ship
then
sinking
ripe
to
us
my
wife
more
careful
for
the
latter
born
had
fasten
d
him
unto
a
small
spare
mast
such
as
seafaring
men
provide
for
storms
to
him
one
of
the
other
twins
was
bound
whilst
i
had
been
like
heedful
of
the
other
the
children
thus
disposed
my
wife
and
i
fixing
our
eyes
on
whom
our
care
was
fix
d
fasten
d
ourselves
at
either
end
the
mast
and
floating
straight
obedient
to
the
stream
was
carried
towards
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
the
sun
gazing
upon
the
earth
dispersed
those
vapours
that
offended
us
and
by
the
benefit
of
his
wished
light
the
seas
wax
d
calm
and
we
discovered
two
ships
from
far
making
amain
to
us
of
corinth
that
of
epidaurus
this
but
ere
they
came
o
let
me
say
no
more
gather
the
sequel
by
that
went
before
duke
solinus
nay
forward
old
man
do
not
break
off
so
for
we
may
pity
though
not
pardon
thee
aegeon
o
had
the
gods
done
so
i
had
not
now
worthily
term
d
them
merciless
to
us
for
ere
the
ships
could
meet
by
twice
five
leagues
we
were
encounterd
by
a
mighty
rock
which
being
violently
borne
upon
our
helpful
ship
was
splitted
in
the
midst
so
that
in
this
unjust
divorce
of
us
fortune
had
left
to
both
of
us
alike
what
to
delight
in
what
to
sorrow
for
her
part
poor
soul
seeming
as
burdened
with
lesser
weight
but
not
with
lesser
woe
was
carried
with
more
speed
before
the
wind
and
in
our
sight
they
three
were
taken
up
by
fishermen
of
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
another
ship
had
seized
on
us
and
knowing
whom
it
was
their
hap
to
save
gave
healthful
welcome
to
their
shipwreck
d
guests
and
would
have
reft
the
fishers
of
their
prey
had
not
their
bark
been
very
slow
of
sail
and
therefore
homeward
did
they
bend
their
course
thus
have
you
heard
me
sever
d
from
my
bliss
that
by
misfortunes
was
my
life
prolong
d
to
tell
sad
stories
of
my
own
mishaps

solinus
and
for
the
sake
of
them
thou
sorrowest
for
do
me
the
favour
to
dilate
at
full
what
hath
befall
n
of
them
and
thee
till
now
aegeon
my
youngest
boy
and
yet
my
eldest
care
at
eighteen
years

inquisitive
after
his

importuned
me

hear
it
dromio
of

may
he
not
do
it
by

yes

why
is
time
such
a
niggard
of
hair
being
as
it
is
so
plentiful
an
excrement
dromio

because
it

and
what
he
hath
scanted
men
in

he
hath
given
them
in

why
but
there

many
a
man

of
syracuse
not
a
man
of
those
but
he
hath
the
wit
to
lose

why
thou
didst
conclude
hairy
men
plain
dealers
without

the
plainer
dealer
the
sooner
lost
yet
he
loseth
it
in
a
kind
of

nay
not
sound
i
pray
you
dromio

and
did
sir
namely
no
time
to
recover
hair
lost
by

i
amazed
ran

she
had
transform
d
me
to

with
such
a
gentle
sovereign
grace
of
such
enchanting
